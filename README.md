Yes, I am simply yet another random student from a random high school located in a random city named Hangzhou.

**Sorry, but I have to focus on the Chinese-style high school courses on workdays. Issues, PRs, etc. will be reviewed on weekends.**

Learning ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-ff7a9e?style=flat-square&logo=Rust&logoColor=ffffff). Perhaps I will ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-ff7a9e?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=ffffff) one day.

Feel free to pronounce "NKID00" in any way. However, calling me by my nickname "NK" is preferred to avoid unnecessary tangling with the pronunciation.
