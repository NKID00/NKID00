Yes, I am simply yet another random student from a random high school located in a random city named Hangzhou.

**Sorry, but I have to focus on the "Chinese-style" classes on workdays. Issues, PRs, etc. will be reviewed on weekends.**

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-ff7a9e?logo=python&logoColor=ffffff) is my favorite programming language. I can also code in ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%2B%2B-ff7a9e?logo=C%2B%2B&logoColor=ffffff), ![C♯](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%20♯-ff7a9e?logo=C%20Sharp&logoColor=ffffff) and a little bit of ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-ff7a9e?logo=Java&logoColor=ffffff).

Perhaps I will learn ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-ff7a9e?logo=JavaScript&logoColor=ffffff) one day.

Feel free to pronounce "NKID00" in any way. However, calling me by my nickname "NK" is preferred to avoid unnecessary tangling with the pronunciation.

I really enjoy watching animes. Check out [![my Moegirlpedia user page](https://img.shields.io/badge/-my%20Moegirlpedia%20user%20page-ff7a9e)](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/User:NKID00) (Chinese version only) for further information about me.
